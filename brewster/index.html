		Brewster's Millions is the story of how one man, desiring the American Dream, got more than he bargained for.
			<br />
		Monty Brewster was a Minor League baseball player on a road to nowhere. However, a stroke of luck ensured he was the last living heir of one of the richest men in America, a sadistic bastard who set Brewster a challenge in his will: 
			<br />
		<strong>To spend thirty million dollars in a single month while accumulating no assets.</strong>
			<br />
		If he succeeded he would be rewarded with the full inheritance of <i>$300 million</i>
			<br />
		If he failed, he would get nothing.
			<br />
		</p>
		
		<hr />
		
		<p> The challenge had strict rules:
			<ol>
				<li>He could not accumulate any assets, such as  houses, cars, stocks and bonds.
				</li>
				<li>
				He had to return in exactly thirty days with nothing but the shirt on his back.
				</li>
				<li>
				He needed receipts for all purchases(handled by an accountant supplied by the executor of the estate).
				</li>
				<li>
				He could hire anyone he wanted, but had to get <i>value</i> for their services.
				</li>
				<li>
				He could not destroy anything inherently valuable (no buying and burning Picassos...)
				</li>
				<li>
				He could not simply buy a large gift and give it away, although he could do so for smaller gifts (this is not very well explained in the movie).
				</li>
				<li>
				He could only gamble away 5%.
				</li>
				<li>
				He could only give 5% to charity.
				</li>
				<li>
				He wasn't allowed to tell anyone <i> why </i> he needed to spend the money.
				</li>
			</ol>

		<hr />
		
		<p>
		Sounds difficult, right? Well, it made a fun movie!
